# Quadruped

8 DOF quadruped robot using one of my SEA for N20 motors. The project was not completed as the motors did not have enough torque, as they were fake Pololu's.

There are some example files in the src folder, for running a SEA module and two in series (leg).

The parts files are in the parts folder. They are .step and .f3z.
